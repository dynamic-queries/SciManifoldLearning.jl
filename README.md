# Sci-ManifoldLearning.jl

Manifold Learning Algorithms are used prevalantly in the Scientific community for Model Reduction, System Identification and as Efficient Surrogates for computationally expensive tasks.

We aggregate such algorithms for wider use in the Julia ecosystem.

For the next 6 months, we will focus on approximation algorithms for the following Linear Operators.
- Laplace-Betrami Operator
- Koopman Operator
- Frobenus-Perron Operator
- Dynamic Laplacian
